- Hi  everyone!
🔭 I´m an aspirant to become a future professional in cyber security. I´m so excited to be part of this field. My commitment as a future security analyst is to protect the organization's network, data, and people who are valuable assets to the public, private, and government.    

🏋️ My  strengths: 
 

1- I´m very calm, diligent, and logical personally focused on finding the clue and giving the solution. For example, I  will  analyze  the breaches   without  causing panic  in the organization, including  starting a meticulous investigation about  the  threat  actors that  sent the attack.
  
2.- Logical intuition  helps me  ensure the  protection  of the organization  by applying protocols for risk  management  at the beginning  of the  security operation.
3.- I will specialize in the use of writing the  correct code  to  retrieve information that was stolen by threat actors. I think that connecting  my  intuition and code skills  will help me to be   ready  to  see vulnerabilities and act  against a threat.

 my value :
I consider  myself a person who likes to keep confidentiality and ethics. commitment to my job overall the  responsibility  at all  levels of my life including  personal identification  like  my performance  on task to  stop the attacks employed  in future  threats, not just only  focusing on a target   of the organization  but also respecting the  rules, compliance, and the low  established  by the policies of the  risk manager  of the organization.

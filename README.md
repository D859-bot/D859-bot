🏋️ My  strengths: 
 

1- I´m very calm, diligent, and logical personally focused on finding the clue and giving the solution. For example, I  will  analyze  the breaches   without  causing panic  in the organization, including  starting a meticulous investigation about  the  threat  actors that  sent the attack.
  
2.- Logical intuition  helps me  ensure the  protection  of the organization  by applying protocols for risk  management  at the beginning  of the  security operation.
3.- I will specialize in the use of writing the  correct code  to  retrieve information that was stolen by threat actors. I think that connecting  my  intuition and code skills  will help me to be   ready  to  see vulnerabilities and act  against a threat.

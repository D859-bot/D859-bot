- Hi  everyone!
🔭 I´m an aspirant to become a future professional in cyber security. I´m so excited to be part of this field. My commitment as a future security analyst is to protect the organization's network, data, and people who are valuable assets to the public, private, and government.    
🏋️ My  strengths:
1-I´m very calm, diligent, and logical personally focused on finding the clue and giving the solution . For example,  I  will  analyze  the breaches   without  causing panic  in the organization ,
   including  starting a meticulous investigation about  the  threat  actors that  sent the attack.
2.- Logical intuition  helps me  ensure the  protection  of the organization  by applying protocols for risk  management  at the beginning  of the  security operation.
